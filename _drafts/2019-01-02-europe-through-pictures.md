**Spain**

When I reached Barcelona in November 2017, the Catalan Independence Movement had started gaining momentum. 

A couple of days into my stay, I ventured out one evening only to stop dead in my tracks in the middle of a street when a strange noise started reverberating through the city – a hundred, thousand utensils banging in sync. At the time, unaware of the Catalonia agitation (locals would bang utensils in their homes every day at ten as a way of protest), I naturally jumped to other conclusions, one of them that perhaps locals were protesting against tourists (just the day before, I had spotted several posters in a neighbourhood that told tourists to “GO BACK!“)

At the time, I did not have a local number or data on my phone. I had no means to communicate with the handful of contacts I had in the city to find out the cause behind the commotion. Fighting dread, I walked back home to find out the real reason later.

A few more days into my stay, everyday protests became my new sense of normal. However, it also put me in situations most interesting. For one, buses would change routes or halt abruptly mid-way every time massive protests broke out (and they did frequently back then). The announcements would of course be in Spanish and I would alight at unknown places with no knowledge whatsoever of what was going on. (I had started learning Spanish only a couple of weeks before in India.) 

I eventually made peace with the inevitable uncertainty that plagued me often during my year long stay in Barcelona.

**Norway**

Within a month of arriving in Barcelona, I travelled to Norway with a friend to fulfill a dream that had marinated in my head for long - watch the Northern Lights.

My stay in Norway brought forth a set of contradicting emotions. Daylight lasted no more than 3-4 hours. The weather was perpetually frigid and morose. I would feel anything but jovial eating lunch in the dark. In the end however, it was all worth it as I got to witness ribbons of green and purple unfurl and sway across the sky in a spectacular show that will remain etched in my memory in vivid detail for many, many years to come.

**Portugal**

Soon after, I left for Portugal with another friend. Together we drove through the southern coastline of Portugal with miles and miles of spectacular beaches for company. Watching the sun set from what was once believed to be the end of the world remains my fondest memory from the country.

**Italy**

I travelled next to Italy with a friend to celebrate Christmas with her family and learnt quickly that Christmas celebrations in an Italian family is mostly an exercise in pampering the taste buds silly.

Most of the family could only speak Italian yet they were considerate and kind and made me feel like I was one of them. They were a gregarious bunch and their animated conversations amused me to no ends.

**Prague, Czech Republic**

This was my first solo trip in Europe. Prague was every bit like the fairy tale I had heard it would be. I skipped most touristy places and walked for hours at ends exploring the city and the various surprises it had to offer.

**Budapest, Hungary**

Budapest and Prague are like twin cities. However, my experience in both places was anything but similar. I met rude and obnoxious people wherever I went - right from the restaurant I stopped over for lunch, to the lady living in the same building as the hostel where I had put up, even the teenagers on the street. 

Watching the sun rise from Fisherman's Bastion(a popular tourist attraction) and having it to all to myself saved my trip from becoming an absolute disaster.

**Iceland**

When I landed in Iceland at 12 in the night with my parents, it was still bright outside. We watched incredulously locals jogging at midnight. 

Like winters in Norway, the Icelandic summer confused me as the sun never set. 

The landscape baffled me too. It was unlike anything I have ever seen - sand the colour of charcoal, icebergs floating like diamonds in lagoons, the surprises never ceased.

**Croatia**

My journey to Croatia started on a sour note. I landed in Zagreb, Croatia’s capital and largest city. On my way from the airport to the city in a tram jam-packed with people, I almost lost my passport and residence permit to a pickpocket. (Without the residence permit, I would not have been able to enter Spain after my trip.) While the incident shook me up, I continued on my journey, alert than usual.

I spent three days in the heaven i.e., Plitvice Lakes National Park. The changing colours of its magical waters, quiet little beaches of the Croatian islands and the old town of Dubrovnik reminiscent of a film set together made up for the disastrous start I had to the trip.  

https://www.instagram.com/p/BrK5NOhAcwz/ - The Plitvice Lakes never look identical on two consecutive days. From bright emerald green to turquoise to even grey, the waters change colour depending on the ever fluctuating amount of minerals and organisms. Of course, sunlight plays its part too.

I was thrilled beyond measure when I left for Europe. Like every other Indian, my imagination fed by Hindi movies and photographs of stunning landscapes, I believed strongly that this was to be the holy grail of all my travel experiences so far.

After living in Spain and travelling across Europe for a year, I realized that the continent’s rosy reputation starts to wear off once you observe it from close quarters. 

I have seen the Catalan agitation up-close. I have been a victim of eve-teasing on several occasions. I was almost robbed once. I have walked down dangerous alleys, as dark and as dirty as one would find them anywhere else in the world.

I have had some fantastic experiences too.

I celebrated Christmas with locals, shared with them the warmth of their hearts and homes. I found guardian angels in strangers all over Europe. I experienced their madness and eccentricities and understood that they are no different than us in most ways.

All of this together taught me one simple thing - Europe is like any other place in the world. Beneath its pretty cover lies a story of existence as plagued with problems and evils as anywhere else. 

To travel somewhere and to live in that place are two entirely different experiences. The former, by design, rarely offers a deeper insight into a place and its culture. The latter does exactly the opposite. Perhaps there lies the allure of travel. It offers only one-half of the truth and it suits our convenience too, to accept that the

In Kolhapur, Maharashtra, we watched a group of children practice a martial art form called mardani khel. When we came back, we tried to trace the origin of this martial art form that few know about. History books yielded nothing, so we spoke to its practitioners, some of whom have been practicing for over 3 decades. In this video, we capture our understanding of the origin of mardani khel, which we have gathered after research spanning over several weeks.

I was sauntering around the village of Longkhum like a cow amid green pastures, a lunatic’s grin plastered on my face. After an arduous journey and a painful night in a place I can best describe as a trucker’s motel, I had somehow hacked my way into this remote village that has very likely seen no more than half a dozen outsiders till date. 

I had been walking around the village for several hours since that morning, making a mental note of every blossom, every hiding spot of the many cats and hens that co-existed there with the amicable Ao Nagas. Suddenly, I halted in my tracks. A woman, face heavily wrinkled and back bent over, was smearing cow dung on the porch of her house. The sight immediately transported me to my father’s village of Khuntubandha in Odisha where I would, as a young girl, watch my late grandmother toil away in her mud house as she smothered the floor with cow dung. 

I walked up to the woman, clearly in her seventies, like my eight-year-old self once used to, to my grandmother. Breathing deep that familiar scent of my childhood, I said the brightest “Hello” that my knotted stomach could muster.

She looked up, arms covered with brown slime up until her elbows and smiled indulgently.

“Can I help you?” I asked.

She turned her head in a peculiar manner, straining to hear me, confusion writ large on her face.

_“Kya main apki madad kar sakti hoon, daadi?”_ (Can I help you, granny?) 

She tried hard to read the words on my lips that her ears clearly failed to hear. After a few more attempts, I decided it was best to let the poor lady finish her work in peace. Waving my hand like a zealous child expecting a crisp note of ten as he bids farewell to his grandparents, I walked away. 

“Hey! Hey, you!”

I turned around wondering - what was this Hindi movie anti-climax unraveling in a Naga village?

A much younger lady, now standing next to the woman, beckoned me over.

“Come have tea with us, she wants to know your name!”

I walked into their traditional Naga home and sat down with the daughter, the mother and the hundred-year-old grandmother. It bore that familiar musky scent that I have now come to associate with every Naga household made of bamboo. There, three generations of Ao women and I sat down to discuss their lives over cups of tea. The grandmother recollected vaguely the chain of events that led to losing her younger brother in the Battle of Kohima in 1944. 

In March 1944, the Japanese Army found their way into India through the dense jungles of Burma (Myanmar). Named Operation U-go, their plan was to take Imphal and then Kohima. 

The British were surprised by their move to attack Imphal. They expected Dimapur to come under siege since it had the main supply depot for troops in the north east. If Dimapur collapsed, the British army would struggle for rations and ammunition.

However, the Japanese wanted Kohima as it lay perched at the summit of a pass, offering the best route for the Japanese to move into India. Once they broke through the hills of Nagaland, they could reach Dimapur on the plains, subsequently enter Assam and move towards Delhi.

Although the British had a garrison in Kohima, it had never been central to their plans. British and Indian forces at Kohima numbered around 1,500, stationed along with about 1,000 non-combatants.

The Japanese army numbered close to 15,000.

A bloody battle ensued, possibly one of the worst during the Second World War. Although the battle ended in victory for the British, the empire was never the same again; the end of British Raj in India was near. For Japan, the loss ended its imperialist ambitions.

“The stench of corpses lingered for many, many weeks…sometimes at night, till this day, I wake up to that smell…” The granddaughter translated her _otzy’s_ (grandmother’s) words.

I remembered then walking around the war cemetery in Kohima, reading carefully every single gravestone. There was one that has stayed with me since - “You will be missed by the son who has never seen you.” 

I don’t remember exactly for how long we sat together, but it was long enough for damp eyes to light up with laughter.

Realizing suddenly that I was overstaying my welcome, I got up to leave.

The grandmother said something that I could not discern. The granddaughter flailed her arms and issued a warning - “Don’t you go away till I return!” She then went running upstairs. 

My tea cup sat in front of me half-full and cold.

I could hear her above me as she ran around the room, opening and closing what I guessed were cabinets.

She returned soon, with a humble smoking pipe in her hands and said, “My great-grandmother made this with her own hands. It has been passed down in the family and used by three generations of women.” She put the pipe in my hands. “We want you to keep this, to remember us by.”

It was an astonishing gesture, to offer a family heirloom to a stranger. I tried to refuse but they did not let me leave until I accepted their generous gift. And now, a dusty, old smoking pipe sits next to my bed, reminding and reinforcing many, many things…

I have never been a mountain person. I have never been a beach person either. Eventually, one beautiful sight makes way for another. I am however a people person. In them I find my most honest intent to see this world. In them I uncover and discover the places that I visit. In their kitchens I find the scent of generations already spent. In their pain, I understand humanity. And in their warmth, I discover mine.

_“Ek! Don! Teen! Char!”_{:title="One! Two! Three! Four!"}

_“Aunty, haath peeche karo na!”_{:title="Aunty, please move your hand!"} I told the woman standing behind me, although I knew it wasn't her fault that her hand was pressed against my buttocks. We were among a crowd of thousands—packed tight like honeycombs of a beehive—who had gathered on Lakshmi road to watch the Ganpati procession before _visarjan_{:title="Immersion of the Ganesha idol in a water body, thus concluding Ganesha festival that is celebrated for ten days."}.  

_“Ganpati chya jai jai kaar!”_{:title="Praise Lord Ganesha."}
 
I was standing on my toes, trying to see what the infinite wave of bobbing heads was hiding from me. I could hear it in the distance though, that sound, like a storm heading towards me.

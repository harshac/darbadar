Harsha and I looked outside the window, careful not to brush our shoulders against the piece of chewed gum stuck to the edge of the window frame. The bus was wedged in a narrow alley between makeshift shops with tin roofs, raucous hawkers selling their wares on hand carts, people scuttling along, careful not to step into the open drains that ran along the road, all populating a claustrophobic space. It could have been any town, its appearance nondescript, but deceivingly so, as we would discover. 

The bus-stop was a few kilometers away but we got down early. As the *lal dabba*(translation: red box), a term used to describe MSRTC(Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation) buses, trudged along in a drunken stupor, we made our way across the road to a small workshop hiding behind blue plastic covers. 

The workshop, only slightly bigger than a closet, housed a bunch of rusted steel racks, their tops touching the roof and filled with brooms, paints and Ganesh idols, all jostling for space.

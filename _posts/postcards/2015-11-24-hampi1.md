The _ghat_{:title="In Indian context, a flight of steps leading down to a river, especially one used for bathing."} stole a peek from beneath garments that lay upon it drying in the sun. The river waters shook off their morning breath. The copper bell tinkled, swaying as it did with her every step, her wet skin leaving a trail of water behind.    

“We missed seeing her taking a bath!” I said to Harsha, the only time in my life I wished for such a thing. 

We had just reached the banks of the Tungabhadra after a twenty minutes rickshaw ride from Hospet bus-stop. It was eight in the morning and the bank was abuzz with people performing their morning rituals: an old woman grunted as she slapped a bright orange garment on a boulder and then wrung it till the veins in her arms popped; three teenage boys braved the cold water in their underwear, trying their best to pass off as the red-blooded males they thought they were, defeated by their scrawny bodies and awkward moustaches, the girls watching them barely impressed; a pudgy man in a _dhoti_{:title="A garment worn by Hindu men by tying around the waist."} and a furtive look on his face launched a ball of phlegm noisily before disappearing behind a few shrubs tucked between two boulders, the _lota_{:title="A spherical pot made of brass or copper used to carry water, usually for cleaning oneself after going to the toilet."} in his hand doing little to hide his secret.

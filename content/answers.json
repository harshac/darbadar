      "Hey @xopj,\n\nReally sorry for the trouble. We’re trying to take care of this problem but are having troubles reproducing it. In the meantime, some other people have found success using the Git Bash instead of the default included Windows Command Prompt.\n\nI will try and investigate it more, would you mind sharing the version of Node, npm, Surge, and git you are using with me? You should be able to get those with the following command:\n\n```\nsurge --version\nnode --version\nnpm --version\ngit --version\n```\n\nWould you also mind testing for me if you can install other modules globally? Ex. what happens when you try and `npm install -g browserify`? There has been some indication it might be a problem with installing modules globally, not specifically with installing Surge.\n",

A month before floods hit Jammu and Kashmir in September 2014, Harsha and I went for a trek in the Himalayas that started in Sonmarg. Although we both saw the worst of each other in the course of that trek, we also managed to curb our desires to kill each other. And yet, surprisingly, we both ended up having the best time of our lives. We realized that we could bear each other just a little more than we give ourselves credit for.

Our first impressions about each other weren't exactly great. She thought I had really strange hair. I thought she was plain strange. Our opinions haven't changed much in the last four years. What has changed though is our appetite to sink our teeth into different cultures, experience unknown lands and being in awe of things that we haven't seen before.

This blog is an attempt to document our travel experiences, a task that we are highly unlikely to commit ourselves to, unless faced with the intimidating proposition of having other people taking a look at it. But something tells us that we will find more reasons...eventually.

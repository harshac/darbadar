Darbadar, a word of Farsi-Urdu origin, means door-to-door or door-after-door. It is used to signify someone who has no home, or one who is wandering from one place to another, hoping for a refuge.  

To us, the word darbadar embodies the spirit of a traveler. There is a strange sense of gratification to be derived out of being displaced, and to still feel like you are home.     

Harsha and I are two very odd people who also happen to be friends. We love traveling together. Most of the times. When we get too bored of each other, we travel alone. And the first thing we do when one of us comes back from our solo trips, is to blab all about them to the other. Since we are getting bored of doing that as well, we thought we would find more people to blab to.
